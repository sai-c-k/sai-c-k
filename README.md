Hello World! My name is ***Sai C. Kotikalapudi***. I'm a passionate and experienced Software Engineer. I have a decade of experience designing, developing and deploying software.

## Experience

![golden experience](https://media.tenor.com/274j_RLtt6UAAAAC/giorno-gold-experience.gif)

My experiences stand with me. I strongly believe in going deep and wide to gain a broader perspective; So, I have worn many hats in my decade long career, like:

- :construction_worker_man: **Backend Engineer [Expert]:** Building globalized multi-tenanted microservices from scratch with the `-ilities` is my forte.
- :man_factory_worker: **Devops [Expert]:** I've dockerized, K8s-deployed and CI/CD-ed for services, libraries and images.
- :man_artist: **Front-end Engineer [Practitioner]**:  As a recent full-stack engineer, I've focused on delivering responsive feature-rich pages with an eye for usability.
- :male_detective: **Project Manager [Practitioner]**: Given a product's need, I've scoped, curated technical deliverables and delegated detailed tasks all while meeting milestones.
- :guard: **Scrum Master [Practitioner]:** I've measurably improved productivity by 10% as a scrum master. Trust me! On an average salary of 100K per dev, that is 50K saved for a 5-man dev team.
- :farmer: **Mentor [Practitioner]:** Initially, I heavily focused my early career on vertical scaling. Since, I've started to help horizontally scale teams by teaching folks to fish in lieu of a quick meal.
